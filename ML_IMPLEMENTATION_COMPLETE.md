## 🧠 AI Brain Service Integration

### ML Capabilities Loading
```python
# All ML capabilities are now loaded automatically:
self.ml_capabilities = {
    'lstm': LSTMPredictor(),           # ✅ Neural network predictions
    'ensemble': EnsembleManager(),     # ✅ Multi-model ensemble
    'kelly': PositionSizingAPI()       # ✅ Optimal position sizing
}
```

### Signal Enhancement
Every trading signal now includes:

### Example Enhanced Signal
```python
signal = TradingSignal(
    signal=SignalType.BUY,
    confidence=0.72,
    reasoning="LSTM + Ensemble consensus",
    # NEW: Kelly Criterion attributes
    kelly_position_size=2850.0,       # $2,850 position
    kelly_position_pct=0.029,         # 2.9% of capital
    kelly_win_probability=0.68,       # 68% win probability
    kelly_method='kelly_ml_enhanced'   # ML-enhanced method
)
```
