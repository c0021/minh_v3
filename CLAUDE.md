## üí° Key Development Principles

### Architectural Guidelines
- **Additive Enhancement**: New features augment, never replace existing foundation
- **Complete Transparency**: All AI reasoning must remain observable
- **Process-Focused**: Decision quality prioritized over outcomes
- **Resource Realistic**: Optimized for retail trader constraints ($150/month budget)
- **üö® ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FAKE DATA**: NO simulation, mock, fallback, or fake data EVER

### Philosophy Alignment Requirement  
All development must support core principle: **"Making the best decisions possible with available information and resources"**

### üö® CRITICAL: NO FAKE DATA POLICY
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: MinhOS NEVER uses simulation, mock, fallback, or fake data of any kind.
- **Real market data ONLY**: All decisions based exclusively on live Sierra Chart data
- **Fail honestly**: System must show ERROR/DISCONNECTED when no real data available
- **No consciousness maintenance**: Never pretend to be "alive" with fake data
- **Real trading only**: Every price, volume, signal must come from actual market sources
- **Zero simulation**: No SimulationAdapter, mock data, or fallback generation EVER

**Rationale**: Trading with fake data creates false confidence and dangerous decisions. System integrity requires brutal honesty about data availability.

## üîÑ Memory System Usage

### For Development Decisions
1. **Update relevant memory file** with new context
2. **Reference CLAUDE.md** for navigation and current status
3. **Cross-reference philosophy docs** for alignment verification

### For Context Retrieval
1. **Start with CLAUDE.md** for current development state
2. **Navigate to specific memory files** for detailed context
3. **Reference philosophy/technical docs** for foundational information

---

**Philosophy**: This unified memory system ensures no brilliant ideas are lost and provides instant context for any future development work. Every architectural decision and development insight is preserved and easily accessible.
