# MinhOS v3 - Master Development Index

This file serves as the **central navigation hub** for all MinhOS v3 development context and documentation.

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-24  
**Current Focus**: Chat Interface Integration with Kimi K2 API  

---

## üéØ Active Development Context

### Current Development Phase: Chat Interface Integration (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Transform MinhOS from sophisticated trading system ‚Üí conversational trading assistant  

**Status**: Planning complete, ready for implementation  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with basic chat interface

### Key Context from Current Session
- **Kimi K2 API**: Available in `.env` but not yet integrated  
- **Architecture Decided**: Chat layer augments existing services (no replacement)
- **Integration Strategy**: Natural language ‚Üî structured queries ‚Üî conversational responses

## üöÄ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Chat Interface Foundation (Next 30 days)
- [ ] Basic WebSocket chat endpoint
- [ ] Simple command parsing (no AI initially)
- [ ] Connect to existing services for basic queries
- [ ] Kimi K2 API integration for natural language processing

### Phase 2: Advanced Chat Features (30-90 days)
- [ ] Context-aware conversations  
- [ ] Multi-turn dialogue support
- [ ] Advanced trading command interpretation
- [ ] Voice input capabilities

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement (90-180 days)  
- [ ] Machine learning optimization based on decision quality
- [ ] Multi-asset analysis capabilities
- [ ] Predictive modeling with probability assessments

## üí° Key Development Principles

### Architectural Guidelines
- **Additive Enhancement**: New features augment, never replace existing foundation
- **Complete Transparency**: All AI reasoning must remain observable
- **Process-Focused**: Decision quality prioritized over outcomes
- **Resource Realistic**: Optimized for retail trader constraints ($150/month budget)

### Philosophy Alignment Requirement  
All development must support core principle: **"Making the best decisions possible with available information and resources"**

## üîÑ Memory System Usage

### For Development Decisions
1. **Update relevant memory file** with new context
2. **Reference CLAUDE.md** for navigation and current status
3. **Cross-reference philosophy docs** for alignment verification

### For Context Retrieval
1. **Start with CLAUDE.md** for current development state
2. **Navigate to specific memory files** for detailed context
3. **Reference philosophy/technical docs** for foundational information

---

**Philosophy**: This unified memory system ensures no brilliant ideas are lost and provides instant context for any future development work. Every architectural decision and development insight is preserved and easily accessible.

**Next Action**: Begin chat interface implementation using context from `docs/memory/chat_interface.md`
