# MinhOS v3 Implementation - Architecture Consolidation + ML Enhancement

**Created**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Clean architecture implementation (v2 plan) followed by ML feature integration  
**Timeline**: 9 days consolidation + 8 weeks ML features  

## 🎯 Current State vs Target State

### Current Architecture (CHAOS)
- 15+ service files with tangled dependencies
- Configuration scattered across 60+ files  
- Hardcoded "NQU25" symbols everywhere
- Ports/IPs duplicated in multiple places
- Quarterly symbol rollover = manual nightmare

### Target Architecture (CLEAN)
- 4 core services + 2 interface layers
- Single config_manager.py for ALL configuration
- Symbol management already centralized (✅ DONE)
- Clean service boundaries with clear APIs
- ML features as pluggable capabilities

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Consolidation (Days 1-9)
Clean up existing chaos before adding ML features

### Phase 2: ML Feature Integration (Weeks 1-8)
Add LSTM, Ensemble, and Kelly Criterion as clean capabilities

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Read PHASE_1_CONSOLIDATION.md for the 9-day plan
2. Start with Day 1: Creating config_manager.py
3. Update DAILY_PROGRESS.md after each session
4. Once Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2 ML features

## ⚠️ Critical Rules
1. **NO FEATURE LOSS**: Every existing feature must work after consolidation
2. **INCREMENTAL**: Test after each major change
3. **DOCUMENT**: Update progress daily for session continuity
4. **VALIDATE**: Run validation checklist before proceeding
