## Quick Reference

**Current Status**: Not Started  
**Next Session**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Dependency Injection  
**Priority**: Modify LiveTradingIntegration to include chat service  

## Implementation Sessions

- **Session 1**: Foundation & Dependency Injection
- **Session 2**: AI Brain Interface Implementation  
- **Session 3**: Sierra Client Data Access
- **Session 4**: Advanced Chat Features
- **Session 5-6**: Polish & Testing (if needed)

## Key Files to Modify

1. `minhos/services/live_trading_integration.py` - Add chat service initialization
2. `minhos/services/ai_brain_service.py` - Add missing methods for chat
3. `minhos/services/sierra_client.py` - Verify data access methods
4. `minhos/services/chat_service.py` - Enhance handlers and error handling

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Chat service receives proper dependency injection
- ✅ Chat can query live market data from Sierra Client
- ✅ Chat can access AI Brain analysis and ML predictions  
- ✅ Chat provides intelligent responses about LSTM, Ensemble, and Kelly Criterion
- ✅ System remains stable during and after integration

## Notes

This implementation uses a gradual rollout strategy with feature flags to ensure system stability. All changes are designed to be non-disruptive to existing MinhOS functionality.
