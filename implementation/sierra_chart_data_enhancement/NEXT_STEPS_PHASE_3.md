## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Phase 3)**

### **Priority 1: Microsecond Timestamp Precision**
**Current**: 1-second updates via Sierra Chart timestamp  
**Target**: Microsecond precision for tick-level accuracy  

**Action Items**:
1. **Modify ACSIL Study** to capture high-resolution timestamps
2. **Add Windows Performance Counter** integration to ACSIL code
3. **Update JSON output format** to include microsecond timestamps
4. **Test precision accuracy** against Sierra Chart internal clock

**Expected Impact**: Critical for order flow analysis and market microstructure

### **Priority 2: Individual Trade Record Capture**
**Current**: Aggregated 1-second bars  
**Target**: Every single trade with exact price, size, timestamp  

**Action Items**:
1. **Enable tick-by-tick mode** in ACSIL study
2. **Create trade buffer system** to handle high-frequency updates
3. **Implement trade record streaming** via enhanced JSON format
4. **Add trade direction detection** (buyer/seller initiated)

**Expected Impact**: Full market transparency for AI decision-making

---

### **Priority 3: Full Tick-by-Tick Processing**
**Current**: 1Hz JSON file updates  
**Target**: Sub-millisecond trade processing pipeline  

**Action Items**:
1. **Optimize file I/O performance** in ACSIL study
2. **Implement memory-mapped file sharing** for zero-copy data transfer
3. **Add circular buffer architecture** for high-throughput processing
4. **Test maximum tick rate handling** during market peaks

**Expected Impact**: Real-time trading execution capability
