# ML-Enhanced Kelly Criterion Implementation
**Week 5-6 of Phase 3: ML Features Implementation**

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement ML-Enhanced Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing based on AI model predictions

**Duration**: Week 5-6 (2 weeks)  
**Priority**: High - Critical bridge between ML predictions and trading execution  
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## üöÄ Strategic Value

### The Kelly Criterion Formula
```
f* = (bp - q) / b
```
Where:
- `f*` = Optimal fraction of capital to bet
- `b` = Odds received (reward/risk ratio) 
- `p` = Win probability (from ML models)
- `q` = Loss probability (1 - p)

### Why This Is Critical
1. **Mathematical Optimization**: Converts ML confidence into mathematically optimal position sizes
2. **Risk Management**: Prevents overleverage while maximizing long-term growth
3. **AI Integration**: Transforms predictions into actionable trading decisions
4. **Process Focus**: Aligns with your philosophy of systematic, data-driven decisions
