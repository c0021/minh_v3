# MinhOS v3 Service Architecture Redesign - Implementation Plan v2

**Created**: 2025-07-25  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Priority**: High - Addresses architectural debt and service coupling issues

## Overview

This implementation plan documents a comprehensive service architecture redesign to address the "layered additions" problem where new services were bolted onto existing ones without proper integration. The goal is to transform MinhOS from a collection of tightly-coupled services into a proper distributed system with clear contracts and boundaries.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Implicit Coupling**: Services assume methods exist without formal contracts (e.g., `TradingEngine.get_positions()` error)
2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Bridge returns dictionary but services expect single objects
3. **Direct Method Calls**: Services call each other directly, creating tight coupling
4. **No Dependency Management**: Services start without ensuring dependencies are ready
5. **Scattered Service Discovery**: Each service has its own way of finding others
6. **No Health Monitoring**: Failures cascade without proper isolation

### Root Cause Analysis
The system evolved by adding new features without refactoring existing architecture. Each new service was integrated using whatever interface the existing services exposed, rather than defining proper contracts first.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Contract-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Replace direct calls with pub/sub messaging  
3. **Explicit Dependencies**: Services declare what they need and provide
4. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and dependency tracking
5. **Gradual Migration**: Incremental refactoring without system downtime

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure for service contracts and communication

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Service contract interfaces (`ITradingEngine`, `IMarketDataProvider`, etc.)
- [ ] Centralized service registry with contract validation
- [ ] Event bus for pub/sub messaging
- [ ] Standardized data models with versioning
- [ ] Health monitoring framework

#### Files to Create
- `minhos/core/service_contracts.py` - Interface definitions
- `minhos/core/service_registry.py` - Centralized service discovery
- `minhos/core/event_bus.py` - Pub/sub messaging system
- `minhos/core/health_monitor.py` - Service health tracking
- `minhos/models/events.py` - Event schemas

### Phase 2: Service Migration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Migrate existing services to new architecture one by one

#### Migration Order
1. **Market Data Service** (least dependencies)
2. **State Manager** (foundational service)
3. **Sierra Client** (data provider)
4. **Risk Manager** (business logic)
5. **AI Brain Service** (complex logic)
6. **Trading Engine** (most dependencies)

#### Migration Process per Service
1. Define service contract interface
2. Implement contract in existing service
3. Register service with service registry
4. Replace direct calls with event pub/sub
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Validate migration with integration tests

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Complete event-driven communication and dependency management

#### Deliverables
- [ ] All services communicate via EventBus
- [ ] Dependency management system operational
- [ ] Health monitoring dashboard integration
- [ ] Service startup orchestration
- [ ] Comprehensive integration test suite

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Validate new architecture and ensure no regressions

#### Deliverables
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing no degradation
- [ ] Service isolation tests (one service failure doesn't crash others)
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Production deployment validation

    @abstractmethod
    def subscribe_to_updates(self, callback: Callable[['MarketData'], None]): ...
```

### Service Registry
```python
class ServiceRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self._services: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        self._contracts: Dict[str, type] = {}
        self._health_status: Dict[str, ServiceHealth] = {}
        self._event_bus: EventBus = EventBus()
    
    def register(self, name: str, service: Any, contract: type):
        """Register a service with contract validation"""
        if not isinstance(service, contract):
            raise ContractViolation(f"Service {name} doesn't implement {contract.__name__}")
        
        self._services[name] = service
        self._contracts[name] = contract
        
        # Subscribe to service health updates
        self._event_bus.subscribe(f"{name}.health", self._update_health)
        
        logger.info(f"Service {name} registered with contract {contract.__name__}")
    
    def get(self, name: str, contract: type = None) -> Any:
        """Get service with optional contract validation"""
        service = self._services.get(name)
        if not service:
            raise ServiceUnavailable(f"Service {name} not found")
        
        if contract and not isinstance(service, contract):
            raise ContractViolation(f"Service {name} doesn't implement {contract.__name__}")
        
        return service
    
    async def start_all_services(self):
        """Start services in dependency order"""
        # Build dependency graph
        dependency_graph = self._build_dependency_graph()
        
        # Start services in topological order
        for service_name in self._topological_sort(dependency_graph):
            service = self._services[service_name]
            await service.start()
            logger.info(f"Started service: {service_name}")
```

### Event Bus
```python
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self._subscribers: Dict[str, List[Callable]] = defaultdict(list)
        self._event_history: deque = deque(maxlen=1000)  # Keep last 1000 events for debugging
    
    async def publish(self, event_type: str, data: Any, metadata: Dict = None):
        """Publish event to all subscribers"""
        event = Event(
            type=event_type,
            data=data,
            metadata=metadata or {},
            timestamp=datetime.now(),
            id=str(uuid.uuid4())
        )
        
        self._event_history.append(event)
        
        # Notify all subscribers
        subscribers = self._subscribers.get(event_type, [])
        tasks = []
        
        for handler in subscribers:
            try:
                if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(handler):
                    tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(handler(event)))
                else:
                    handler(event)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Event handler error for {event_type}: {e}")
        
        # Wait for async handlers
        if tasks:
            await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: Callable):
        """Subscribe to event type"""
        self._subscribers[event_type].append(handler)
        logger.debug(f"Subscribed to {event_type}")
    
    def unsubscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: Callable):
        """Unsubscribe from event type"""
        if handler in self._subscribers[event_type]:
            self._subscribers[event_type].remove(handler)
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
class HealthMonitor:
    def __init__(self, service_registry: ServiceRegistry):
        self.service_registry = service_registry
        self.health_checks: Dict[str, ServiceHealth] = {}
        self.monitoring_active = False
    
    async def start_monitoring(self):
        """Start continuous health monitoring"""
        self.monitoring_active = True
        asyncio.create_task(self._health_check_loop())
    
    async def _health_check_loop(self):
        """Continuous health checking loop"""
        while self.monitoring_active:
            try:
                for service_name, service in self.service_registry._services.items():
                    health = await service.health_check()
                    self.health_checks[service_name] = health
                    
                    # Publish health status
                    await self.service_registry._event_bus.publish(
                        f"health.{service_name}", 
                        health
                    )
                    
                    # Check for unhealthy services
                    if health.status == "unhealthy":
                        logger.warning(f"Service {service_name} is unhealthy: {health.errors}")
                
                await asyncio.sleep(10)  # Check every 10 seconds
                
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Health check error: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

## Migration Strategy

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Migration**: One service at a time to minimize risk
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Old interfaces remain until migration complete
3. **Feature Flags**: New architecture can be toggled on/off
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for each migration step
5. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to old architecture if issues arise

### Success Metrics
1. **Zero Downtime**: System remains operational during migration
2. **No Feature Regression**: All existing functionality preserved
3. **Improved Reliability**: Reduced coupling leads to better fault tolerance
4. **Better Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation
5. **Performance Maintenance**: No degradation in system performance
